        This thesis implements Jussi Rintanen's algorithm for schematic invariants. The algorithm is implemented in the planning tool Fast Downward and refers to Rintanen's paper Schematic Invariants by Reduction to Ground Invariants. The thesis describes all necessary definitions to understand the algorithm and draws a comparison between the original task and a reduced task in terms of runtime and number of grounded actions.
